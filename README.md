## TwitterClone

This twitterClone is a project I Built following the directions of the Let's Build That App
Twitter series. it uses LBTAComponents and SwiftyJSON frameworks to build an app that
looks similar to the official witter app's timeline. 

All of the code is either a direct copy of, or derivitive of Brian Vong's code for shown in those videos.

All of the videos and Vong's orginal source code can be found at https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course_video?id=662
